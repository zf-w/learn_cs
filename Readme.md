# Learning Computer Science

This is Zhifeng's repository trying to archive some of his solved programming challenges in a somewhat structured way.

## Previous Attempt:

Previously, I tried to use another repository [(link)](https://github.com/zf-w/learn_cs_old) to archive those solved problems. I have added my thoughts on each problem into the root README file, but I found that's a somewhat unmanageable way in the long term. In addition, I didn't have a way to actually run those C++ codes in the previous repository.

From April of 2024, I start to slowly archive my reflections and thoughts on these daily problems.
